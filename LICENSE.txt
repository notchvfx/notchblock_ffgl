        -   "use of the Software" means loading the Software into
            temporary memory or permanent storage on a single computer,
            provided that installation on a network server for
            distribution to other computers is not "use" if the Software
            is licensed under this licence for use on each computer to
            which the Software is distributed.

        -   except as expressly stated in this clause 4, you have no
            right (and shall not permit any third party) to copy, adapt,
            reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, adapt or
            make error corrections to the Software in whole or in part
            except to the extent that any reduction of the Software to
            human readable form (whether by reverse engineering,
            decompilation or disassembly) is necessary for the purposes
            of integrating the operation of the Software with the
            operation of other software or systems used by you.

        -   You acknowledge that we may modify, suspend or discontinue
            the whole or any part of the Software or otherwise make any
            changes we consider desirable to the Software, without
            further notice to you.

        of the Software, and uninstalling/deleting all instances of the
        Software downloaded on all of your devices.

    2.  Termination or expiry of this EULA shall not affect any rights,
        remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties that have
        accrued up to the date of termination or expiry, including the
        right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the agreement
        which existed at or before the date of termination or expiry.

        forms of protection of a similar nature or having equivalent or
        similar effect to any of these which may subsist anywhere in the
        world, in each case for their full term, and together with any
        renewals or extensions.

    2.  You acknowledge that all Intellectual Property Rights in the
        Software belong and shall belong to us or the relevant
        third-party owners (as the case may be), and you shall have no

    3.  If any claim or action is brought against you alleging that the
        possession or use of the Software (or any part thereof) in
        accordance with the terms of this EULA infringes the
        Intellectual Property Rights of a third party (Claim), or if, in

            Software and all copies thereof,
